Data Science Fall 2014 Health Project
===
**This project analyzes the Health data from the ggplot2 package which has been supplemented with additional synthetic data and stored in an Oracle database.**

###This is how my RStudio is configured:
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

###These are the packages I load from .Rprofile:
```{r}
# To get this to work in your environment, change the following directory/folder path to the path to your project files.
setwd("/Users/ljs1988/Desktop/health")
system("cat .Rprofile", intern = TRUE)
```
